<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>INetSim Setup</h1><br/><p>Once you install remnux and Flare, make sure you set up your virtual box so that the VM NIC is not set to NAT but set to a host only adapter, and that remnux and flare can communicate with each other. </p><p></p><p>Remnux and flare clean vms can be downloaded at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11-d9MfCbitiyt4OmT-oP-vSeR9viUuRn">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11-d9MfCbitiyt4OmT-oP-vSeR9viUuRn</a></p><p></p><p>We have Remnux (Linux VM) because its nice to have a host that the malware was not intended to detonate on. </p><p>Remnux also acts as an internet simulator </p><p></p><p></p><p>INetSIM on remnux is going to make the malware think that we connectable to the internet </p><p>It&#39;s going to respond to any intrenet requests that the malware makes </p><p>Remnux is also going to allow to use network analysis 	</p><p>	Wireshark and TCPDump</p><p>	</p><p>FlareVM is going to help us with Host based indicators and Remnux is going to help us with network based indicators </p><p></p><p><img src="images/1-1.png" alt="images/1-1.png" /></p><p></p><p>In remnux </p><p>	sudo nano /etc/inetsim/inetsin.conf and remove the comment flag for start_servicedns</p><p>	uncomment out service_bind_address and set the address to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) </p><p>	uncomment out dns_default_ip and set dns default ip to remnux IP (10.0.3 in my case) </p><p>	ctrl + O saves the file in nano then ctrl + x exits nano</p><p>	run inetsim to make sure that all the services are running and to start the internet simulation </p><p>	</p><p>In flare	</p><p>If you go to 10.0.0.3 in google chrome you will be directed to Inetsim homepage </p><p>If you go to http or <a href="https://10.0.0.3/bad.exe">https://10.0.0.3/bad.exe</a>, instead of giving a 404 error, you will download a inetsim generated bad.exe so the malware thinks that the second stage payload has been delivered </p><p></p><p>In flare </p><p>Set DNS settings to remnux box (10.0.0.3)</p><p>Now all domain requsts will be responded to by remnux </p></div>
